```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Article summary



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
print(dataframe)
```

```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,
tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60))
```
