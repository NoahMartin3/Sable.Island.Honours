#  Feral horse activity reduces environmental quality in ecosystems globally

This meta analysis looked at horse populations across five continents and their effects on plants (58% of studies) and soils (35% of studies). Two-thirds of the studies were from North America (47%) and Oceania (21%).

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
print(dataframe)
```

```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,
tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60))
```
