#  Feral horse activity reduces environmental quality in ecosystems globally

### **Introduction**

This paper is a meta analysis looking at horse effects on all aspects of an ecosystem and the impacts of horses. This paper is looking at quantitative effects of feral horses on ecosystems worldwide. Environmental quality, is defined as the status of ecosystem characteristics in natural or human constructed systems that are important for sustaining all living organisms. Feral horses threaten native wildlife directly by competing for resources, or indirectly, by reducing resource quality and thus altering the availability of food, water and habitat (e.g. polluting streams, reducing grass cover, trampling nests). Evidence suggests that horses disproportionately use some landscape positions such as streambeds and open areas more intensively than others, thereby heavily concentrating their impacts in riparian areas and grasslands or meadows. Horse-induced changes to vegetation structure in a range of systems, including streambank stability in riparian areas, have been shown to facilitate the invasion of exotic plants and impact multiple species including aquatic fauna invertebrates, small mammals, and birds. 

Understanding the general trends in horse impacts improves our understanding of how horses might affect ecosystems and therefore how they can be managed more effectively, helping land managers, administrators, governments and policy advisers to make appropriate decisions to mitigate their impacts.

### **Methods**

This study used key words to find papers include soil, horse, environment, vegetation, ecolog, crust, hydrolog, and feral. All keywords were searched within five letters of the word to include any endings that might be used. They also searched many different large databases including *Web of Science*, *Scopus*, *Proquest Science & Technology*, and more. Data was also measured in atributed an amount of horse activity in four horse categories, none, low, medium, and high. The amount of horse activity was highlighted because the density of horses plays a role in how much damage a site will experience. The final database consisted of 64 ecological response attributes, which were categorized into 12 broad categories (animal richness, animal abundance, bacterial abundance, plant biomass, litter cover, plant abundance, plant cover, plant richness, soil physical, soil chemistry, soil organics, and soil erosion).

The paper calculated a log response ratio as the effect size to determine the effect of feral horse on ecological attributes. Positive values from this ratio indicate an increase in the measure of environmental quality with greater feral horse activity and vice versa. This approach might have potential shortcomings given our assumption that increases in a given attribute (e.g. shrub cover, soil carbon) indicate an increase in functionality and therefore greater environmental quality which the authors identified. However, in the absence of the additional information on how an increase in a particular attribute affects function, we assume increases lead to greater ecosystem function. A random effects models to estimate mean effect sizes for feral horse impacts. All of our models had an intercept of zero and included random factors to structure a variance matrix to account for three potential sources of non-independence: i) data collected from the same study, ii) residuals of each observation from calculations of the variance and the potential bias from sample size, and, iii) shared controls among observations from a single study that reported multiple levels of feral horse activity but only a single control (e.g., lower activity level or no activity plot). 

From all of the studies, this meta-analysis had a total of 78 publications and 4261 rows of data from across the world. Tests performed suggested some publication bias in the ecosystem function dataset. 

### **Results and Conclusion**

This meta analysis looked at horse populations across five continents and their effects on plants (58% of studies) and soils (35% of studies). More than two-thirds of the studies were from North America (47%) and Oceania (21%).

##### Three main results were found: 

Low horse activity to no horse activity found that a little horse activity to be neither negative or positive for environmental quality. Further research may even find there to be a significant positive correlation with low horse activity and environmental quality compared to no horse activity. 

When comparing medium horse activity to high horse activity there was a significant decline (15%) in environmental quality. This result is consistent with other literature. 

A significant decline (19%) in ecosystem function associated with feral horse activity was found. This reduction is associated with the capacity to support critical ecosystem functions. Reductions in plant production by about 25% was seen but not unexpected because this reduction is from direct herbivory by horses or indirectly by trampling. The main effects of feral horse activity were related to reductions in plant biomass and litter cover, and increases in soil erosion, with some evidence that feral horse activity reduced microbial abundance and animal richness. 

The preferred food item of horses is graminoids rather than forbs and shrubs. This preference can lead to the conversion of grasslands to shrublands. The disproportionately use of landscapes by horses has can play a big role in how a landscape changes over time. This change in structure and function of an ecosystem is taken into consideration in the analysis. Ecosystem structure, function, and composition were identified as meaningful and able to be scaled up for assessment of the response of ecosystems to feral horse activity.
